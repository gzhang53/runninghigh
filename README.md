** On the first page which is bio.html, users are able to submit their basic information. once the user submit his/her information, their info will be sent to server.Later on , user should be able to login with their email address. Database will use user's email address as primary (unique) key. 

**On the group.html, Because users will only see this page after login or registration, server will retrieve personal data of the certain user and post the info on the group page. There would be one leader user in each group, which is used as primary key in the group table in the database.

**On the stats.html, users will be able to see various statistics. For instance, how long the user run in a week, how long they run in each day. As it is a web based app, so users have to open the browse to let the app record their data, like the distance they run. Google map api should be implemented, as it will be essential to record distance.

**On the home page, it should be a general overview.
